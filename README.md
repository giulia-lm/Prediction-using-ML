# Machine-Learning-Project
This repositorie contains two projects that uses different models to classify and use regression on two datasets respectively.

## Description
- The classification practice is made on a Kaggle dataset containing the detailed information about different penguin species, a model is trained to classify between the species.
- On the other hand, the regression practice dataset is about the analitical data from a certain band on spotify, two different models were trained to predict numerical information about it.

## Getting Started

### Libraries used
- pandas (to manage and pre-process the datasets)
- scikitlearn (used a few functions to pre-process and all the models to train the model?)
- matplotlib & seaborn (to plot the results)

### Project files
Inside this repository you will find two folders (classification and regression), one por each project. Each folder contains the main '.ipynb' where the project and a detailed explanation for each step lies and a '.csv' containing the datasets obtained from Kaggle.

## Notes
This was a uni practice to my "Machine Learning" subject.
